# My-Professional-Portfolio

# Description 
In this project, the goal was to create our professional portolio that we are going to be using throughout the course. Since this was an even numbered assignment all the code was done from scratch. Hopefully this project can showcase how i've grown throughout the course, and how much I have improved since the last assignment. I did feel a lot more comfortable on this project compared to the last one.
